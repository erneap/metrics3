  <h1>Adding a New User</h1>
  <img src="../images/admin_newuser.png">
  <p>
    Everyone who needs to access this web application must have an account, so 
    new users must be created, editted and deleted.  On this page we will 
    discuss how to create a new user.
  </p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      Before you start to add a new user, check the Current User List for the 
      user so you don't create multiple user records.  Edit a user already
      present instead.
    </li>
    <li>Select "Add New User" in the Current User List.  This will change the 
      User's Profile section to allow you to edit all the fields then add the 
      user.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user's email address must be different than anyone elses, so ask 
      for an email to base the user's account, it should be unique.  I recommend an email 
      address connected to your military, company or personal accounts.  No emails 
      will be sent to this address at this time, so don't expect any from this 
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name information (first, middle and last) is self-explanatory, edit 
      any you need to change.
    </li>
    <li>
      Password/Verify:  The user's password only lasts for 90 days before it is 
      locked and they have to see the administrator.  The new password is first 
      checked for complexity (min 10 characters in length, and 2 of each type of 
      character (lower case, upper case, numeric, and other characters)).  Then, 
      the second or verify inputs is compared against the first input area.
    </li>
    <li>
      Permissions:  As the administrator, you need to determine which areas the 
      user needs to access.  It really affects which mission sensor the user 
      can edit and whether the user access to this page.  Please limit the 
      number who have the ADMIN permission to a minimum.  FYI:  An administrator 
      also has access to all of a mission's sensor views to edit all of them.
    </li>
    <li>
      After all the fields are entered, click the "Add User" button to send the 
      user's information to the database.
    </li>
