  <p>
    The whole purpose of the application is the creation of required reports 
    for the various entities needing them.  Two types of reports are currently 
    available: Mission Summary and DRAW Report.  Each report is created as an 
    Excel (xlsx) file and will be downloaded automatically to your designated 
    download folder.
