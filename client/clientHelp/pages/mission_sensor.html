  <h1>Reviewing the Missions(One Week)</h1>

    I've separated the Mission Sensors from the mission because you won't see 
    all of them unless you are an administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a good look at the three sensor type editors, because the various
    fields are different.  All the sensors have space for kit number, sensor
    final status code, pre-mission, scheduled, executed/on-station and 
    post-mission times, sensor and ground equipment outage times and comments
    specific to the sensor.  The GEOINT and DDSA sensor views have times for 
    additional after-mission complete (post-mission ring).  Only DDSA has a 
    checkbox for HAP and Tower identifier. Lastly, the other sensor has time spaces for partial 
    outages.

  <p><span class="importantNote">NOTE: </span>All values are automatically 
    loaded into the database after it changes.
  </p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      GEOINT Exploitation Sensor:  This selects the GEOINT sensor on the aircraft.  
      Some aircraft have two possible values, so select the applicable one for 
      the mission.
    </li>
    <li>Kit Number:  (Optional) The kit number is the serial identifier for the 
      aircraft sensor package.  
      This value to typed in and can include numbers and/or letters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Final Code: (Optional) The sensor's final status code is a choice of 10 
      values (0 - 9) which is 
      provided by the maintainers to you, or your teammates.  Choose the correct
      final status code.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mission Tower: (Optional) This selector field gives the editor a choice
      of values (1-3) to represent the tower being used for the mission.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pre-Mission, Scheduled, Executed, Post-Mission, Additional Ring Times:
      (Required) These values are in hours:minutes format for the amount of time 
      in each stage of the mission.  7:15 value would indicated that stage took 
      7 hours and 15 minutes.  <span class="importantNote">Standard values for 
      Pre, Scheduled and Post will initially be provided.</span>
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>Pre-Mission Time: The time before launch where the sensor managers are 
          preparing for the mission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scheduled Time:  The time that was scheduled by the planners from 
          launch-landing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Executed Time:  The amount of time, as determined, where the sensor 
          managers are monitoring/managing the sensor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Post-Mission Time:  The amount of time after landing until all sensor 
          managers action are complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional Ring Time: Occassionally, additional time is needed for 
          the sensor managers to complete the mission after execution time/ 
          landing is complete.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Sensor, Total Sensor, Partial HB, Partial LB, and Ground Outage Times: 
      These times are for recording the amount of elapse time was needed to 
      return the mission for the various outage types.  These times are in 
      minutes, but should never exceed the executed time.  There is no verifier
      to ensure this.
      <ol class="level2">
        <li>
          Total or Total Sensor Outage Time:  These two values could be considered 
          synomymous.  They are the number of minutes the entire sensor is off-line 
          and unable to complete the mission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Partial LB or Partial HB Outage Time:  These two values are available 
          to record the number of minutes the sensor is partially available for 
          the mission, with the part not working correctly annotated in minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ground Outage Time:  The amount of time the ground equipment is not
          available to complete the mission.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Has HAP Checkbox:  No explanation given.  Check is necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sensor Comments:  (Optional) The field is provided to record any comments 
      needed to be recorded that are sensor, rather than mission, related.
    </li>
