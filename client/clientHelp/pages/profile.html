  <h1>Changing Your Information/Password</h1>
  <p>
    You can change your user information and password!</p>
  <p>
    First, click on the Profile Icon (<img src="../images/Profile_Icon.png">) in 
    the upper-right corner of the display.  This will open the editor where you 
    can edit your email address, name and to set a new password.
  </p>

  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      Your email address must be different than anyone elses, but since you 
      receive email on that account, it should be unique.  I recommend an email 
      address connected to your military, company or personal accounts.  No emails 
      will be sent to this address at this time, so don't expect any from this 
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name information (first, middle and last) is self-explanatory, edit 
      any you need to change.  The change will be recorded after completion.
    </li>
    <li>
      Password Changes:  Your password only lasts for 90 days before it is 
      locked and you have to see the administrator.  The new password is first 
      checked for complexity (min 10 characters in length, and 2 of each type of 
      character (lower case, upper case, numeric, and other characters)).  Then, 
      the second or verify inputs is compared against the first input area. 
      After both input areas are typed in and the password is checked for 
      complexity and verified, the "Change" button will appear and you can click 
      it to set the new password.
