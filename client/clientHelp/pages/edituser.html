  <h1>Edit/Delete a User</h1>
  <img src="../images/admin_edituser.png">
  <p>
    User data will need to be edited, an account unlocked, passwords changed, 
    and/or permissions changed.  All changes for selected user are updated 
    immediately in the database.
  </p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      Start by selecting a user from the "Current User List".  This will display 
      what is already in the database for you to edit.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user's email address must be different than anyone elses, but since they 
      receive email on that account, it should be unique.  I recommend an email 
      address connected to your military, company or personal accounts.  No emails 
      will be sent to this address at this time, so don't expect any from this 
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name information (first, middle and last) is self-explanatory, edit 
      any you need to change.  The change will be recorded after completion.
    </li>
    <li>
      Password Changes:  Their password only lasts for 90 days before it is 
      locked and you have to see the administrator.  The new password is first 
      checked for complexity (min 10 characters in length, and 2 of each type of 
      character (lower case, upper case, numeric, and other characters)).  Then, 
      the second or verify inputs is compared against the first input area. 
      After both input areas are typed in and the password is checked for 
      complexity and verified, the "Change" button will appear and you can click 
      it to set the new password.
    </li>
    <li>
      Account Unlock:  This requires a password change, so see the item above.
    </li>
    <li>
      Permission Groups:  The user's workcenter should be selected as the user's 
      primary permission group. If the user is selected to be an 
      administrator, then selected that group.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <span class="importantNote">Delete User</span> As an administrator, you need 
    to be aware when a user no longer needs access to the application. 1) select 
    the user to delete from the "Current User List", 2) click the "Delete User" 
    button.  This will bring up a verification for the deletion.  Click yes on
    the verification dialog to complete the deletion.
