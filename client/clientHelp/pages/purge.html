  <h1>Purging Old Mission/Ground Outages</h1>
  <img src="../images/admin_purge.png">
  <p>
    Every year we may need to purge old mission and ground outages from the 
    application's database.  So a procedure has been added to do this on the 
    administrator's page.  You need to to the purges of missions and ground 
    outages separately.
  </p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>
      Choose whether you want to purge Missions or Ground Outages.  Select the 
      purge type.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, select the Purge Date by using the calendar icon inside the 
      input field to show a calendar, then move to the first date you want to 
      keep.  This date is not included in the purge, but everything before this 
      date will be removed from the database.  It is not recoverable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the "Purge" button.  This will bring up a verification dialog to
      verify you really want to delete these old records.  Click "Yes" to 
      proceed and the request will be sent to the server for completion.
    </li>
  </ol>
