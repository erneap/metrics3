  <h1>Entering a Ground Equipment Outage</h1>
  <img src="../images/ground_out.png">
  <p>
    A ground outage is defined as a any outage to ground equipment that might stop or 
    degrade this mission of exploitation.  The loss of a single zone on a node 
    where backup zone is available and works <span class="importantNote">IS NOT</span>
     an outage, but the loss of two of three might be a degradation that could 
    affect the mission.  Check with your supervisor for more clarification.
  </p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>Ground System:  The application provides a list of ground systems to
      choose.  Just select the appropriate system.
    </li>
    <li>
      System Enclave:  After you selected the overall ground system, the system 
      enclave select is provided a list of appropriate enclaves the system is 
      available on.  Choose the correct enclave, understanding that sometimes
      only one will be available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Outage Date:  This field is for the date the outage occurred.  Click on 
      the icon in the field and a calendar will appear to allow you to choose 
      the correct date.
    </li>
    <li>
      Outage Number:  This field is normally automatically created, if you 
      select "New" in the drop-down.  If this system/enclave already has an 
      outage on the date selected, it will also appear to allow you to edit, 
      rather than create a new outage.  It is at this point that the outage 
      will be created or if a number was selected, it will be viewed in its 
      present form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Outage Time:  This field provides the amount of time the outage occurred 
      in minutes.  Use a calculator if need be, but I hope the outage is of
      short duration.
    </li>
    <li>
      During Mission Checkbox:  Check this box if the outage occurred during 
      a mission affecting the collection of information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subsystem(s):  (Optional) This field is free text and allows you to 
      identify the ground system's subsystems affected by the outage.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serena Ticket #:  This field provides a reference to the SERENA ticketing 
      system where more complete information should be entered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Major Area: (Optional) This provides another area to describe the areas 
      within the ground system the outage affects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Problem/Fix Actions(s):  These areas provide you the opportunity to 
      annotate what the problem looked like and what actions were completed to
      fix it.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <span class="importantNote">Clear the Outage: </span> If you need to clear 
    the displayed outage, just click on the Clear Icon 
    (<img src="../images/clear_icon.png" class="icon">) in the upper-right

    <span class="importantNote">Delete the Outage: </span> If you need to delete 
    the current displayed outage from the database, click on the Delete Icon 
    (<img src="../images/delete_icon.png" class="icon">) in the upper-right portion of the 
    outage view.  You will be asked to verify the deletion, realizing that all 
    of the outage's data will be removed from the database and unrecoverable.  
    See below for an image of the verification dialog.
