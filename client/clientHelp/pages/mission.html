  <h1>Editing the Basic Mission Information</h1>
  <img src="../images/empty_msn.png">
  <p>
   You'll notice in the empty mission display only allows you to choose the 
   mission date, platform and sortie identifier.  When you enter or choose the 
   mission date and platform a list of current missions are then listed in the 
   sortie id selector with the first sortie in the list displayed.  If no 
   missions are for that date and platform, none will be displayed and you will 
   have to choose the "NEW" sortie id to create one.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Create a new mission:
    <ol class="level1">
      <li>Click the calendar icon in the Mission Date Editor.  this will bring 
        up a calendar to allow you to pick the date for the mission.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click in the Platform selector and choose the aircraft type from the 
        list provided.  If missions for this date and platform are already in 
        the database, they will be listed in the Sortie ID selector with the 
        first mission's data displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the Sortie ID selector and ensure the new mission isn't already 
        listed.  If not, click the "NEW" choice in the selector.  A dialog will 
        display to ask for the new sortie id.  It must be numeric, normally the 
        last two digits of the mission identifier.
      </li>
      <img src="../images/new_msn_dialog.png">
      <li>
        In the Sortie ID editor, type in the number for the sortie identifier 
        and click the "Ok" button to create the mission.  Click the "Cancel" 
        button at the bottom to stop the process.  The newly created mission 
        will be created using the mission date, platform and sortie identifier 
        provided and will include default values for exploitation, communications, 
        and status (executed).  After it is created, the rest of the mission 
        display will be visible (if not already) and the new mission information 
        will be present.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <ol class="level1">
      <li>Click the calendar icon in the Mission Date Editor.  this will bring

    Your display will be similar to those shown above, the data and edit field 
    will be different.  The sensor edit tabs may be like the U2 mission display,
    where you have multiple selections or only one for the mission, even none
    at all.  These are determined by your workcenter/permission combination.
  </p>
  <p>Now lets go through each field:</p>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li>Mission Exploitation:  (Select One) This is the value for our site's involvement 
      in exploiting the imagery or other information.  Possible values include:
      Primary - done on site, Shadow - receive only for monitoring, Federated - 
      controlled by another site, but helping with the interpretation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tail Number - (U2 Missions only) This is holds the letter designator for 
      the mission aircraft's tail number.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communications - (Select One) This is the way we, or the other site, are 
      reveiving the information from the the mission sensors.  LOS - Line-of-Sight,
      Ext-LOS - Line-of-Sight, but sent to other, Non-LOS - any other method.
    </li>
    <li>
      Primary DCGS - (Select One) This is the site who has control of the 
      mission.  There is a choice for all available sites.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mission Overlap:  (Optional) This value in hours:minutes is the amount
      of time this mission overlaps another or in the area at the same time.  
      4:30 is stating that this mission overlaps another mission for 4 hours and 
      30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Overall Mission Comments: (Optional) This field is used to record any 
      comments that affect the mission as a whole.  There are separate comment
      fields for each sensor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly there are three checkboxes for mission cancellation (before takeoff),
      abort (after takeoff, but before on-station), and indefinte delay.  Check 
      these boxes if needed.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <span class="importantNote">Clear a Mission: </span> If you need to clear 
    the displayed mission, just click on the Clear Icon 
    (<img src="../images/clear_icon.png" class="icon">) in the upper-right 
    portion of the mission view.  This will not delete a mission already created 
    just empty the input fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="importantNote">Delete a Mission: </span> If you need to delete 
    the current displayed mission from the database, click on the Delete Icon
